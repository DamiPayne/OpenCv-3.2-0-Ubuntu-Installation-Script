# OpenCv-3.2-0-Ubuntu-Installation-Script
Script for installing openCV image recognition library from source. Tested on ubuntu 16.0.4.

Most of the credit for this script goes to [milq], (https://github.com/milq/milq "milq's github") I just added the ability to install the extra contributions to extend usage of OpenCV outside the master branch.
## Installation instructions
Download the installation script install-opencv.sh, open your terminal and execute:
`bash install-opencv.sh`

Process can take some time depending on the speed of your computer
